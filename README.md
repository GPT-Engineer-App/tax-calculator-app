Step 1: Set up the basic HTML structure

Create an HTML file and add the basic structure, including a <head> section and a <body> section.
Add a <title> element to the <head> section to set the title of the webpage.
Add a <div> element to the <body> section to contain the entire application.
Step 2: Create the user interface

Inside the <div> element, add the following elements:
A <select> element with an id attribute set to "state" to create a drop-down menu of all 50 US states. You can use an array of state names and abbreviations to populate the options.
A <input> element with an id attribute set to "salary" to allow the user to input their monthly salary.
A <select> element with an id attribute set to "frequency" to allow the user to choose between "Monthly" and "Yearly" salary.
A <button> element with an id attribute set to "calculate" to trigger the calculation of the salary after taxes.
A <p> element with an id attribute set to "result" to display the calculated salary after taxes.
A <button> element with an id attribute set to "dark-mode" to toggle dark mode on and off.
Step 3: Add CSS for styling and layout

Create a CSS file and link it to the HTML file.
Add styles to layout the elements in a visually appealing way, including padding, margins, and font styles.
Add a dark mode style that changes the background color, text color, and other visual elements when the dark mode button is clicked.
Step 4: Add JavaScript for functionality

Create a JavaScript file and link it to the HTML file.
Add an event listener to the "calculate" button to trigger the calculation of the salary after taxes when clicked.
Use the selected state and salary input to calculate the taxes owed based on the state's tax rates. You can use a JavaScript object or array to store the tax rates for each state.
Calculate the salary after taxes by subtracting the taxes owed from the input salary.
Display the calculated salary after taxes in the "result" paragraph element.
Add an event listener to the "dark-mode" button to toggle dark mode on and off when clicked.
Step 5: Add tax rates data

Create a JavaScript object or array to store the tax rates for each state. You can use data from a reliable source, such as the IRS or a tax website.
Add the tax rates data to the JavaScript file, using a format that can be easily accessed and used in the calculation.
